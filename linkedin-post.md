# LinkedIn Post for ExpenseTracker Project

---

🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: ExpenseTracker - A Modern Financial Management Application!** 💰

I've developed a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that helps users track and manage their personal finances efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features:
- Secure user authentication with JWT
- Intuitive expense management with categorization
- Interactive data visualization with charts and statistics
- Category filtering for detailed expense analysis
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Support for Indian Rupee (₹) currency
- Smooth animations for enhanced user experience

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Anime.js, Recharts
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT
- Architecture: RESTful API

This project was a great opportunity to enhance my skills in modern web development practices, state management with Context API, and creating responsive user interfaces.
